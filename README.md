# stillup

A small program to check the status of websites. Actually, just a study in Golang but it works nicely...

It uses a list of url's from a .stillup file in your home directory (e.g. ~/.stillup).

You can add or remove url's from the list:

`stillup add http://atog.nl`
`stillup remove http://atog.nl`
